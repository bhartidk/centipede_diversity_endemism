1. go the bin folder within the biodiverse folder 
2. in a terminal type 
sudo perl BiodiverseGUI.pl
to open the Biodiverse GUI
3. in the biodiverse GUI, click on Basedata and select import from the dropdown menu
4. under the Import dialog, select the location of the input file
5. under the Import options dialog, check the "data are in matrix form option", and select "," as the input field separator
6. select id as the "text_group" variable, set x and y columns to ignore

12. under the analysis tab, select spatial, within which select the following and say go -
Endemism>Endemism whole
Lists and counts>Richness 
Phylogenetic endemism indices>Phylogenetic Endemism
Phylogenetic indices>Phylogenetic diversity
Phylogenetic indices (relative)>Relative Phylogenetic Diversity Type 2 and Relative Phylogenetic Endemism Type2
13. click on analysis > randomisation, keep the randomise function as rand_structured, change the iterations to run as 1000 and click on randomise
14. under the output tab there should be two tabs - spatial and randomise. click on spatial and export. choose spatial in the list to export drop-down and the delimited text format and say next. enter a file name and select location on the right hand panel and say okay - these are the observed values of indices. in the output tab, again choose spatial, select delimited text, say next and choose rand1>>spatial_results, enter filename and say okay - these are the results from randomisation
